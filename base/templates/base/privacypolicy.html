Legally, you are not obliged to provide the Company with personal data, and you hereby confirm that you knowingly and freely provide your Personal Data to it.

If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you will not be able to use the Digital Media.
                 <li />
             </ul>
             <p> The Company reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. The Company will inform you of any changes by publishing them in this Privacy Policy.

             <p>Among the Personal Data requested are, in particular,</p>

             <p style="text-align:center"> 18, rue Molitor 75016 Paris</p>
             <p style="text-align:center"> Email: data@mauna-ai.com</p>
             <p>In general, all data collected is used for the sole purposes for which you have transmitted them, or for any other purpose stated at the time of collection or in this Privacy Policy. These purposes are as follows: </p>
             <ul>
               <li> When you register on the Digital Media, the Personal Data you provide is used to provide you with the benefits and services associated with creating a user profile, including the ability to receive the information and communications selected at the time of registration or automatically associated with your registration (e.g., subscribing to a newsletter, creating an account, providing informational content, using services related to the Application, invitation or participation in an event organized by the Company); </li>
               <li> When you have used the "Invite coach/athlete" feature: the Personal Data requested for one-time use features (typically, names and email addresses) are used only once (e.g., to send communication) and are retained for a period not exceeding 2 years;</li>
               <li> When you subscribe to a subscription on the Digital Media: the Company uses your Personal Data to: <ul>
                   <li> manage the subscription and services offered by the Application</li>
                   <li> feed the Mauna artificial intelligence database and thus improve the services provided via the Digital Media, during the learning phase, to train, test, and improve the algorithm, and during the production phase, to improve the quality of the services on the Digital Media, develop and improve the algorithm; </li>
                 </ul>
               </li>
               <li> When you use a contact form: your Personal Data is used to respond to your request or comment.</li>
             </ul>
             <p> In addition to the purposes for which you have provided your Personal Data, you may also have the opportunity (through a checkbox or otherwise) to authorize the use of your Personal Data for an activity or service that differs from the primary activity or service you are requesting. If you decide to take advantage of these additional services, the Company will use your data to provide them to you. </p>
             <p> The Company may also use your email address to send you transactional or administrative communications (e.g., a confirmation email when you subscribe or unsubscribe to the Application, as well as certain announcements related to services (e.g., notifications regarding updates to its Privacy Policy, addition or discontinuation of features or programs on the Digital Media). </p>
             <p> The Company may also use your Personal and/or demographic data as part of its internal marketing and demographic studies, in order to continuously improve and personalize the services it provides, and better meet your needs. </p>
             <p> The Company may also pseudonymize or anonymize the Personal Data collected. </p>
             <h5>Article 4. Refusal to Provide Personal Data </h5>
             <p> If you decide not to provide your Personal Data when requested, you may not be able to access all the features offered by the Digital Media. Additionally, the personalized features available on the Digital Media will limit the services and special offers that the Company may offer you. For example, if you refuse to provide your email address, you will not be able to receive any newsletters or register on the Digital Media. </p>
             <p> However, if you simply wish to explore the Digital Media and learn more about the Company, it is not necessary to provide any additional Personal Data. </p>
             <h5> Article 5. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Data</h5>
             <p> The Company guarantees the confidentiality of your Personal Data.</p>
             <p>To this end, the Company undertakes never to disclose your Personal Data to a third party intending to use it for direct marketing purposes unless it has expressly informed you of this possibility and has obtained your explicit authorization. </p>
             <p> For the purposes set out in Article 3, the Company may share your Personal Data with third parties, but only in the following cases: </p>
             <ul>
               <li> The Company may transmit certain data from one user to other users of the Digital Media, particularly between coach and athlete, to provide the services associated with the Application, namely, in particular, the transmission of some of the Personal Data between each "athlete" user and their coach, or the transmission of messages between users. </li>
               <li> The Company may use service providers, agents, or suppliers to support the internal operations of the Digital Media and help manage them. These third parties must at all times guarantee the same levels of security as the Company regarding your Personal Data and are bound, where applicable, by a legal agreement under which they are required to preserve the confidentiality and security of your Personal Data and to process it only according to the specific instructions of the Company.</li>
             </ul>
             <p> To this end, the Company uses providers established mainly in the European Union and the United States. The Company makes sure to act responsibly and to interact only with third-party service providers who display a data privacy policy governing their own processing of personal data and who ensure an adequate level of protection in accordance with the requirements of European data protection regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, the "GDPR"). If the Company were to transfer Personal Data beyond the borders of the EEA, it would establish contractual mechanisms and binding legal processes to lawfully transfer and secure these data flows. </p>
             <ul>
               <li> All so-called "sensitive" Personal Data, i.e., medical and health data, are hosted by an approved health data host service provider ("HDS"), which guarantees maximum security and compliance with the recommendations of the CNIL.</li>
               <li>When the Company launches a common service on the Digital Media or in partnership or sponsored by another company, another organization, or a third party, and it collects and processes Personal Data in the context of this event or service, the Company may share your Personal Data with its partner or sponsor. If your Personal Data is collected by (or shared with) a company other than the Company in connection with this promotion, the Company will inform you at the time of the collection of your Personal Data. </li>
               <li>The Company may make your Personal Data known to certain of its employees, who are also subject to a confidentiality obligation, and only within the strict framework of the purposes mentioned in Article 4. </li>
               <li>In the event of a merger or acquisition of the Company, in whole or in part, by another company, or if the Company were to sell or transfer all or part of its business, the acquirer would have access to the information obtained by the Company, including the Personal Data, subject to the applicable laws. Similarly, Personal Data may be transferred in the context of a company restructuring, insolvency procedure, or similar event, if permitted by and in accordance with the applicable legislation. </br> The Company may also disclose your Personal Data when required by law or if it believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal proceedings, respond to any claims, or protect the safety or rights of the Company, its clients, or the public. In this case, the Company undertakes to notify you in accordance with the conditions provided by the applicable legislation. </li>
             </ul>
             <p> The Company may share aggregated information from surveys or statistical information with third parties. However, this information is anonymized and does not contain any Personal Data. The aggregated information shared may include anonymized information collected through the use of cookies and other trackers, as explained in Article 11.
             <p>
             <p> In any case, the Company will make its best efforts to ensure the confidentiality and security of the Personal Data collected when transmitting them to the aforementioned persons. </p>
             <h5> Article 6. Data Retention Period</h5>
             <p> Your Personal Data will be retained by the Company for a period not exceeding the duration necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or processed, in accordance with the applicable provisions. In this respect, the Company keeps your personal data for as long as your user profile has not been deleted (within the limit of the maximum legal retention period for Personal Data), or as long as the contract concluded with you continues.</p>
             <p> The Company may also need to retain your Personal Data for a longer period, solely for the purposes of complying with any legal or regulatory obligations, responding to any questions or complaints that may be addressed to it after the cessation of the contractual relationship with you, settling any disputes, enforcing its contracts, or for any other similar file management purposes.</p>
             <p> The Company may thus retain your Personal Data for a reasonable period following the cessation of the use of the services or Digital Media. Beyond this period, your Personal Data will be deleted from all systems operated by the Company, or anonymized. </br> If you wish the Company to cease using your Personal Data to provide you with services (for example, refuse to receive emails), please contact the Company as indicated in Article 9. </p>
             <h5> Article 7. Security Measures</h5>
             <p> The Company takes the security of your Personal Data very seriously. </p>
             <p> The Company undertakes to take all necessary technical and organizational measures to preserve the confidentiality and security of your Personal Data collected on Digital Media, including your sensitive Personal Data. These efforts include, among others: (i) the storage of your Personal Data in secure operating environments, only accessible to authorized employees of the Company, as well as its agents and service providers; (ii) verification of the identity of registered users, before allowing them to access the Personal Data that the Company holds about them; (iii) internal training and awareness within the Company of the importance of the protection of Personal Data.</p>
             <p> Employees of the Company who have access to your Personal Data by virtue of their duties undertake to maintain the highest level of confidentiality in this regard.</p>
             <p> However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Thus, even if the Company makes its best efforts to protect your Personal Data, it does not control the risks related to the operation of the Internet and draws your attention to possible risks in terms of occasional data loss or breach of the confidentiality of data transiting through this network.</p>
             <h5> Article 8. Links and Interactions with Third-Party Sites</h5>
             <p> The Digital Media may allow you to interact with third-party sites or may contain links to other sites, mobile applications, and third-party services that are neither owned nor controlled by the Company (each a "Third-Party Service"). The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of Third-Party Services. Please note that the Third-Party Service may collect information about you. Therefore, the Company invites you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of each Third-Party Service with which you choose to interact. </p>
             <h5> Article 9. Rights of Individuals regarding Personal Data </h5>
             <p>In accordance with the applicable legislation, and in particular French Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 known as the "Data Protection Act" as amended and the GDPR, you have the following rights: </p>
             <ul>
               <li> a right of access, that is to obtain confirmation as to whether or not Personal Data is being processed and, where such data is being processed, access to such Personal Data, as well as various information including the purposes of the processing, the category of Data, the recipient(s) of the Personal Data, etc.</li>
               <li> a right of rectification, as soon as possible, of Personal Data that is inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or ambiguous, or whose collection and processing are prohibited;</li>
               <li> a right to object to the processing or transfer of Personal Data, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for the Data Controller that override the interests of the Data Subjects; </li>
               <li> a right to erasure of Personal Data that you can request in the cases defined by law for the following reasons: </li>
               <li> a right to limitation of the processing of Personal Data concerning the Client for the following reasons: <ol>
